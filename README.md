# gcloud-switch

A TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool for managing and switching between multiple Google Cloud configurations. Quickly switch gcloud user credentials and Application Default Credentials (ADC) across different projects and accounts. Keeps gcloud and gcloud-switch data in sync.

Fun and learning project of mine from serveral aspects: Rust, OSS, Public Repo, AI.

## Features

- Interactive TUI for browsing and activating profiles
- Manages both **user credentials** (`gcloud auth`) and **ADC** (`gcloud auth application-default`) per profile
- Auto-detects expired tokens and triggers re-authentication before activation
- Visual auth status indicators (🔑 valid / 🔒 expired) per profile
- Import existing gcloud configurations
- CLI subcommands for scripting
- Configurable sync with gcloud configurations (strict, add-only, or off)

## Installation

Requires a working `gcloud` CLI installation.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tjirsch/rs-gcloud-switch/releases/latest/download/gcloud-switch-installer.sh | sh
```

Prebuilt binaries can also be downloaded directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/tjirsch/rs-gcloud-switch/releases) page (macOS Intel + Apple Silicon, Linux x86_64 + ARM64).

### macOS: "zsh: killed" error

macOS Gatekeeper quarantines unsigned binaries downloaded from the internet. To fix this:

**CLI:**
```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/gcloud-switch
```

**GUI:** Right-click the binary in Finder, select **Open**, then confirm in the dialog. Alternatively, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Allow Anyway** after the first blocked attempt.

## Usage

### TUI (default)

```sh
gcloud-switch
```

Opens an interactive table of profiles. Use the keyboard to navigate and activate.

### Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Down` | Move selection down |
| `Up` | Move selection up |
| `Left` | Move column left (Both -> User) |
| `Right` | Move column right (User -> ADC) |
| `Enter` | Activate selected profile(s) and quit |
| `Alt+Enter` | Activate selected profile(s) |
| `a` | Re-authenticate selected profile(s) |
| `e` | Edit selected profile in-place |
| `n` | Add a new profile |
| `d` | Delete selected profile |
| `Esc` | Quit |

#### Edit Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Type | Modify the field value directly in the table cell |
| `Down` | Open suggestion dropdown (known accounts or projects) |
| `Up` / `Down` | Navigate suggestions |
| `Enter` | Pick suggestion (if dropdown open) or save and exit |
| `Tab` | Move from account field to project field; save from project |
| `Esc` | Cancel edit without saving |

Suggestions include all account emails from existing profiles plus all authenticated accounts from gcloud's credential store. Project suggestions also include GCP projects accessible by the entered account.

#### Add Profile

When adding a profile (`n`), you are prompted for: profile name, user account, user project, ADC account, then ADC quota project. Prompts show defaults in **brackets**, e.g. `Enter ADC quota project [my-project]:`. **Press Enter with no input to accept the value in brackets** (ADC account and quota project default to the user account and project you just entered). Type a different value and press Enter to override.

### Column Selection

- **Both** (default): Activates both user config and ADC together
- **User**: Activates only the gcloud user configuration (account + project)
- **ADC**: Activates only the Application Default Credentials

### Sync Modes

Press `s` in the TUI to cycle through sync modes. The current mode is shown in the help bar.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **strict** | Bidirectional sync — creating or deleting a profile also creates or deletes the corresponding gcloud configuration |
| **add** | One-way — new profiles create gcloud configurations, but deleting a profile does not remove the gcloud configuration |
| **off** | No sync — gcloud configurations are not touched |

The sync mode is persisted across sessions.

### CLI Subcommands

```sh
# Add a profile
gcloud-switch add myprofile --account user@example.com --project my-project

# Add with separate ADC settings
gcloud-switch add myprofile \
  --account user@example.com \
  --project my-project \
  --adc-account other@example.com \
  --adc-quota-project other-project

# List all profiles
gcloud-switch list

# Switch to a profile (non-interactive)
gcloud-switch switch myprofile

# Import existing gcloud configurations
gcloud-switch import
```

## Data Flow

### Profile Storage

Profiles are stored in `~/.config/gcloud/gcloud-switch/profiles.toml`:

```toml
[profiles.myprofile]
user_account = "user@example.com"
user_project = "my-project"
adc_account = "user@example.com"
adc_quota_project = "my-project"
```

### Activation

When a profile is activated:

1. **User config**: A gcloud configuration is created (if needed) and activated via `gcloud config configurations activate`, then account and project are set via `gcloud config set`
2. **ADC**: The stored ADC JSON is copied to `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`

### Auth Validation

On startup, gcloud-switch reads `~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db` (a SQLite database maintained by gcloud) to look up stored OAuth2 credentials for each profile's account. It then performs a token refresh request to validate whether the credentials are still valid. The result is shown as a lock indicator:

- 🔑 Token is valid, profile can be activated immediately
- 🔒 Token is expired or missing, re-authentication will be triggered on activation

### Re-authentication

When activating a profile with an invalid token, gcloud-switch automatically runs:
- `gcloud auth login --account=<email>` for user credentials
- `gcloud auth application-default login` for ADC credentials

When activating with the column set to **Both**, this results in two separate browser-based auth dialogs — one for user credentials and one for ADC.

You can also manually trigger re-auth with the `a` key.

## File Locations

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.config/gcloud/gcloud-switch/profiles.toml` | Profile definitions |
| `~/.config/gcloud/gcloud-switch/state.toml` | Active profile state |
| `~/.config/gcloud/gcloud-switch/adc/<name>.json` | Stored ADC credentials per profile |
| `~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db` | gcloud's OAuth2 credential store (read-only) |
| `~/.config/gcloud/configurations/` | gcloud configuration files (written on activate) |
| `~/.config/gcloud/active_config` | gcloud's active configuration pointer |
| `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` | Active ADC file |

cargo fmt                  # Format code
```

### Architecture

Six modules with clear separation:

- **main.rs** — CLI parsing (clap) and TUI lifecycle. Subcommands: `add`, `list`, `switch`, `import`, or no subcommand for interactive TUI. Handles TUI suspend/resume when spawning interactive gcloud auth commands.
- **app.rs** — Core state machine. Manages `InputMode` (Normal, Edit, AddProfile, ConfirmDelete), profile selection, background auth checking, edit suggestions, and pending actions. The `Column` enum controls whether activation targets both user+ADC, user-only, or ADC-only credentials.
- **ui.rs** — Ratatui rendering. Layout is 4 rows: title, table, status bar, help line. Renders inline editing with cursor positioning and dropdown suggestion overlays.
- **gcloud.rs** — All gcloud CLI and OAuth2 integration. Manages configurations via gcloud CLI commands, queries `credentials.db` (SQLite, read-only) for OAuth tokens, validates tokens via Google's token endpoint, and spawns `gcloud auth login` / `gcloud auth application-default login`.
- **store.rs** — Persistent storage in `~/.config/gcloud/gcloud-switch/`. Profiles stored as TOML, ADC credentials as JSON files per profile.
- **profile.rs** — Data structures: `Profile` (user_account, user_project, adc_account, adc_quota_project), `ProfilesFile`, `StateFile`.

### Key Design Decisions

- Auth validation runs on background threads (not tokio tasks) because `rusqlite` and `reqwest::blocking` would conflict with the tokio runtime. Auth checks are deduplicated by account.
- TUI must suspend (restore terminal, drop alternate screen) before spawning interactive gcloud commands, then resume after.
- `PendingAction` enum defers actions that require TUI suspension until the main loop can handle them outside the event handler.
- Profile activation uses gcloud CLI (`gcloud config configurations activate`, `gcloud config set`) to ensure gcloud's internal state stays consistent. ADC file copy is the only direct file operation (no gcloud CLI equivalent exists).

### Dependencies

Key crates: `ratatui` + `crossterm` (TUI), `clap` (CLI), `reqwest` (HTTP for token validation), `rusqlite` with bundled SQLite (credentials.db access), `serde` + `toml` + `serde_json` (serialization), `anyhow` (error handling).
